Name: Neil Johnson
Assignment: Project 1 (Chat Client)
Due Date: 10/28/2018

HOW TO RUN APPLICATION:

To build chatserve.py:
    1)  Type python3 chatserve.py [port number goes here]


To build chatclient.c:
    1) Type make chatclient
    2) Once compiled, type chatclient [flip server you're on] [port number goes here]

I was able to confirm the application ran fluidly on both flip2 and flip 3 when testing the application.
